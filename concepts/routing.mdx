# Hyperion Routing

Hyperion aggregates liquidity from the entire Solana ecosystem, but it shines with its **Multi-Hop** capabilities.

## Routing Engine

At the heart of Hyperion is our proprietary **Routing Engine**. It helps find the most efficient paths by traversing through liquidity sources including:
*   **Vortex DEX**: Our premier concentrated liquidity integration.
*   **Fluxbeam**: Our premier AMM integration.
*   **Bonding Curves (Fogo.fun)**

## Multi-Hop

Direct swaps aren't always the cheapest. Hyperion automatically calculates multi-hop routes (e.g., `Token A -> USDC -> SOL -> Token B`) to find the best price, split across multiple venues if necessary.
