# The Session Model

Hyperion introduces a paradigm shift in Solana DeFi: **Session Keys**.

Instead of signing every single transaction with your main wallet (which is slow, insecure, and annoying), you create a **Session**.

## How it works

1.  **Create**: You derive a temporary, scope-limited keypair (the "Session Key").
2.  **Delegate**: Your main wallet approves this Session Key to spend a specific amount of tokens (e.g., "Max 10 SOL, 500 USDC") for a specific duration (e.g., "1 hour").
3.  **Trade**: The Session Key signs the swap transactions. Because the private key is held in memory (or by your bot), these allow for **zero-latency** execution.

## Security

*   **Non-Custodial**: Your main private key never leaves your wallet.
*   **Scoped**: The session key cannot drain your wallet. It can only spend what you allocated.
*   **Revocable**: You can revoke the session at any time on-chain.
