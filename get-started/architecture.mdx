# System Architecture

## Overview

[Content placeholder: Diagram of Client -> API -> Aggregator -> Solana]

## Components

1.  **API Server**: Handles requests, quotes, and session management.
2.  **Aggregator Engine**: Off-chain pathfinding using Hyperion's smart routing algorithm to split trades across DEXes like Vortex, Raydium, and Orca.
3.  **Smart Contract**: On-chain verification and settlement.
