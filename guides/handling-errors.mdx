# Error Handling

## Common Errors

| Code | Error | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `6001` | `SlippageExceeded` | The price moved unfavorable during the transaction. |
| `6006` | `InvalidOwner` | The account owner does not match the expected program. |

## Debugging

If you encounter a generic "Simulation Failed", check:
1.  Do you have enough SOL for rent?
2.  Is your Session expired?
